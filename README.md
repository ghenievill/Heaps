Priority Queue Using a Heap Structure

# Introduction
This application uses a Priority Queue with a Max Heap. A priority queue is a type of data structure that allows items to be added with a priority. It always makes sure that the item with the highest priority is handled first. This is helpful in real-world situations, like organizing tasks, managing events in simulations, or handling job queues in File System.

# What It Can Do
Insert Elements with Priorities: Users can add elements to the priority queue.
Retrieve the Highest Priority Element: The application ensures the highest-priority element (largest in this case) is always at the top.
Remove the Highest Priority Element: The application allows the removal of the top element while maintaining the heap property.
Display Current Queue: Users can view the current state of the queue at any point.

# Why I Made This Application
I created this application to demonstrate how the heap data structure can be applied in practical scenarios like a priority queue. 
•For me, this was an excellent way to strengthen my understanding of heaps while creating something useful.
•For the community, this application serves as:
A learning tool for beginners to understand heaps and priority queues.
A foundation for more complex systems like schedulers, simulations, and resource management applications.

# How It Contributes
•To Myself: Developing this application honed my skills in data structures, specifically heaps, and helped me understand their real-world applications.
•To the Community:
Education: It serves as an example for students or developers learning about heaps and their implementations.
Utility: The application can be adapted for more advanced purposes, like process scheduling or simulation models in various domains.
